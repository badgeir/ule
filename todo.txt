.cs:
- need to optimimse json string, tostring() takes 160 ms.
- write json strings directly instead?

- implement VectorSpace.Contains()
- Implement VectorMotor.cs

general:
- ule.load should execute Unity in batchmode in 'load' method
- ule.load should build executable (to latest changes eventually) if not already built

- SceneManager must implement two run modes: Discrete and RealTime.
- In Discrete mode, timescale must be 0 between all actions, physics must only be updated on action.
- In RealTime mode, time and physics should run independent of ule, and ule samples the running Unity game on each action.

- Implement config file for setting up SceneManager.
- config should also decide tcp ports for IPC between unity and ule.
- user should be able to decide tcp ports in ule (ule must edit config).

- Linux support
- Multiagent support. SceneManager holds List of ReinforcementAgents?
