- borrow Spaces, Env etc. from gym.
- ULEIface must store actions, and implement available_actions() method (numpy array or dict?)
- ULEIface should not connect in __init__, but rather in a load('game name') method
- ULEIface should execute Unity in batchmode in 'load' method
- ULEIface should build executable (to latest changes eventually) if not already built
- SceneManager must implement two run modes: Discrete and RealTime.
- In Discrete mode, timescale must be 0 between all actions, physics must only be updated on action.
- In RealTime mode, time and physics should run independent of ule, and ule samples the running Unity game on each action.
- SceneManager must be the same for all games (prefab)
- ReinforcementAgent must be the same for all games.
- Dynamic ReinforcementAgent <--> All game specifics lie in motors and sensors (Owned by ReinforcementAgent in dynamic lists).
- Implement config file for setting up SceneManager.
- config should also decide tcp ports for IPC between unity and ule.
- user should be able to decide tcp ports in ule (ule must edit config).

- Linux support
- Multiagent support. SceneManager holds List of ReinforcementAgents?
