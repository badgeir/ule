- fix freeze bug
- allow float reward

.cs:
- implement VectorSpace.Contains()

general:
- ule.load should execute Unity in batchmode in 'load' method
- ule.load should build executable (to latest changes eventually) if not already built

- Implement config file for setting up SceneManager.
- config should also decide tcp ports for IPC between unity and ule.
- user should be able to decide tcp ports in ule (ule must edit config).

- Linux support
